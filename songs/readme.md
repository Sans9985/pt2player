this is where the songs are.

you can put comments in the songs with the following criterias:
  - they must be on a separate line
  - they must start with `:`

there are some songs included, for a better look at the syntax

_note 1: the code cannot support multiple tracks (eg._ `"c[M]","C-1[M]"` _) so try to avoid them. it will be possible in a future update._
**note 2: follow the template, or else you'll get errors!**
